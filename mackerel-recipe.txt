Ingredients:

6 medium mackerel, each weighing about 350g/12oz, cleaned, rinsed and dried
4 tbsp Thai red curry paste
3 tbsp olive oil
juice of 3 lemons
small handful of fresh coriander, roughly chopped

Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to fan 180C/ conventional 200C/gas 6. 
Make 4-5 deep diagonal slashes along both sides of each fish. 
Mix the curry paste with the olive oil and the juice of 1 lemon then rub all over the fish and into the cuts.  

2. Cut six 65 x 30cm sheets of foil and fold each one in half to make a rough square. 
Lay a fish on top of each square, squeeze over the rest of the lemon juice and sprinkle with 
coriander.  

3. Loosely wrap the foil around the fish, and seal the edges tightly. 
Put the parcels on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes. 
Transfer the fish to plates with the juice drizzled over, or give each person a parcel.
